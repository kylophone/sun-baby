â˜€ baby
========

sun baby sleeping on a quilt, shining on the ocean in the sky on his stilts // 
you remind me of something old even though you're so young // 
with your pretty little eyes, and your pretty little tongue // 
sun baby, shine on me.

you're lucky mom don't bury you, like a potato or a gourd //
and dad would never hurt you, not even with his sword //
i grow in the ground like a seed from a juniper // 
you shine in the sky like the star who grabs jupiter // 
sun baby, shine on me.

and pink light it is white light as far as i'm concerned // 
the difference is a little bit, the colors they can stir // 
i hold you in my arms, and you burn me // 
i throw you in the air, and i set you free // 
sun baby, shine on me.
